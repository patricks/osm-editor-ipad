			<Abstract type="html">An RMPolylineAnnotation is a concrete subclass of RMShapeAnnotation that is used to represent a shape consisting of one or more points that define connecting line segments. The points are connected end-to-end in the order they are provided. The first and last points are not connected to each other. The annotation will automatically have a layer created when needed that displays an RMShape.</Abstract>
